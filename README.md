# ReAct Agent with LangGraph

This repository contains the implementation of a **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) agent** built using [LangGraph](https://langgraph.dev). ReAct agents combine reasoning and action to achieve complex problem-solving tasks by leveraging large language models (LLMs) in a graph-based workflow.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **LangGraph Integration**: Utilize LangGraph's stateful, graph-based structure to create dynamic and intelligent ReAct workflows.
- **Reasoning + Acting**: Implements the ReAct framework for agents to reason through problems, take appropriate actions, and iteratively improve outcomes.
- **Customizable Workflows**: Easily modify the graph structure to support a variety of tasks and multi-agent scenarios.
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Includes an example of multiple agents working together to achieve shared goals.
- **Real-World Applications**: Pre-built templates for knowledge retrieval, question answering, and decision-making tasks.

## ðŸ“š Setup
